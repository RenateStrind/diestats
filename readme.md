# Dice Game
I don't know if there is a name for this game. I have taken to calling it poor mans dice. The game consists of 6 six sided dice. The game works on a roll keep system. 
Roll 6 dice. You must keep at least one die. Then roll the remaining dice that are not held. The game is over when you have no more unheld dice. Your goal is to get the lowest score possible.

## Scoring
Dice point values are numeric except for 3's which are worth 0 points.
|Die Value|Point Value|
|---|---|
|1|1|
|2|2|
|3|0|
|4|4|
|5|5|
|6|6|

## TODO
* Statistical analysis of the odds and figure out the optimal play. ie. Always keep 1's 2's and 3's.
* multiplayer
* ai with difficulty
* add betting
